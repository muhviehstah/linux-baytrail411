Microchip USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Hub Controller

The device node for the configuration of a Microchip USB251xB/xBi USB 2.0
Hi-Speed Controller.

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should be "microchip,usb251xb" or one of the specific types:
	"microchip,usb2512b", "microchip,usb2512bi", "microchip,usb2513b",
	"microchip,usb2513bi", "microchip,usb2514b", "microchip,usb2514bi"
 - hub-reset-gpios : Should specify the gpio for hub reset

Optional properties :
 - reg : I2C address on the selected bus (default is <0x2C>)
 - skip-config : Skip Hub configuration, but only send the USB-Attach command
 - vendor-id : USB Vendor ID of the hub (16 bit, default is 0x0424)
 - product-id : USB Product ID of the hub (16 bit, default depends on type)
 - device-id : USB Device ID of the hub (16 bit, default is 0x0bb3)
 - language-id : USB Language ID (16 bit, default is 0x0000)
 - manufacturer : USB Manufacturer string (max 31 characters long)
 - product : USB Product string (max 31 characters long)
 - serial : USB Serial string (max 31 characters long)
 - {bus,self}-powered : selects between self- and bus-powered operation (default
	is self-powered)
 - disable-hi-speed : disable USB Hi-Speed support
 - {multi,single}-tt : selects between multi- and single-transaction-translator
	(default is multi-tt)
 - disable-eop : disable End of Packet generation in full-speed mode
 - {ganged,individual}-sensing : select over-current sense type in self-powered
	mode (default is individual)
 - {ganged,individual}-port-switching : select port power switching mode
	(default is individual)
 - dynamic-power-switching : enable auto-switching from self- to bus-powered
	operation if the local power source is removed or unavailable
 - oc-delay-{100us,4ms,8ms,16ms} : set over current timer delay (default is 8ms)
 - compound-device : indicated the hub is part of a compound device
 - port-mapping-mode : enable port mapping mode
 - string-support : enable string descriptor support (required for manufacturer,
	product and serial string configuration)
 - non-removable-ports : Should specify the ports which have a non-removable
	device connected.
 - sp-disabled-ports : Specifies the ports which will be self-power disabled
 - bp-disabled-ports : Specifies the ports which will be bus-power disabled
 - max-sp-power : Specifies the maximum current the hub consumes from an
	upstream port when operating as self-powered hub including the power
	consumption of a permanently attached peripheral if the hub is
	configured as a compound device. The value is given in mA in a 0 - 500
	range (default is 2).
 - max-bp-power : Specifies the maximum current the hub consumes from an
	upstream port when operating as bus-powered hub including the power
	consumption of a permanently attached peripheral if the hub is
	configured as a compound device. The value is given in mA in a 0 - 500
	range (default is 100).
 - max-sp-current : Specifies the maximum current the hub consumes from an
	upstream port when operating as self-powered hub EXCLUDING the power
	consumption of a permanently attached peripheral if the hub is
	configured as a compound device. The value is given in mA in a 0 - 500
	range (default is 2).
 - max-bp-current : Specifies the maximum current the hub consumes from an
	upstream port when operating as bus-powered hub EXCLUDING the power
	consumption of a permanently attached peripheral if the hub is
	configured as a compound device. The value is given in mA in a 0 - 500
	range (default is 100).
 - power-on-time : Specifies the time it takes from the time the host initiates
	the power-on sequence to a port until the port has adequate power. The
	value is given in ms in a 0 - 510 range (default is 100ms).
